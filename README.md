# üéß Discord Spotify Presence Sync

This Python project allows you to **sync your Spotify activity to your Discord Rich Presence** in real time using **Discord and Spotify WebSockets**.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Displays your **currently playing Spotify track** as a rich presence in Discord.
- Automatically updates your presence when the track changes or playback stops.
- Customizable status with emoji.
- Handles reconnects and heartbeat protocols for both Discord and Spotify.

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- A `.env` file with:
  ```env
  TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
  DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_user_token
  ```
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install aiohttp websockets python-dotenv colorama
  ```

---

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Connects to Discord Gateway** using a bot token for presence updates.
2. **Fetches Spotify token** linked to your Discord account.
3. **Connects to Spotify's WebSocket dealer endpoint** using the retrieved token.
4. **Listens for track playback events**, and when a song is playing:
   - Sends detailed track info (name, artist, album art, timestamp) to Discord.
   - Updates your status to show what you're listening to.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main logic for managing both WebSocket connections and presence updates.
- `DiscordClient`: Handles connection, heartbeat, and presence updates with Discord.
- `SpotifyClient`: Fetches token from Discord API, connects to Spotify, parses track events.
